# MovieApp

This project is a webapp that authenticates users before displaying trending movies. Users can search and view movie details. It runs on angular version 17.3.10.
I have added a github actions pipeline that builds and deploys the webapp, when triggered by a push to this repository.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment 

Check the workflow file in this repository for more on how the deployment is setup.
